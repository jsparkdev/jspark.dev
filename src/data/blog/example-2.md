This blog post demonstrates how to use HTML `<pre>` and `<code>` tags to include code blocks in your Markdown content without encountering parsing issues caused by backticks. This is especially useful when dealing with languages that use backticks or when you want to ensure consistent rendering across different Markdown parsers.

### Why Use HTML for Code Blocks?

Markdown's backtick-based code blocks are convenient, but they can sometimes lead to unexpected results, especially with complex code snippets or when the Markdown parser has limitations. Using HTML's `<pre>` and `<code>` tags provides a more robust and reliable way to include code.

### Example Code

Here's an example of a React component using HTML for the code block:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface Props {
  message: string;
}

const Greeting: React.FC&lt;Props&gt; = ({ message }) => {
  return &lt;div&gt;Hello, {message}!&lt;/div&gt;;
};

export default Greeting;
```

Notice the following:

*   The `&lt;` and `&gt;` are used for less than and greater than symbols, respectively. This is crucial to avoid HTML parsing issues within the code block.
*   The `class="language-tsx"` attribute on the `<code>` tag is used for syntax highlighting (if your Markdown renderer supports it). Replace `tsx` with the appropriate language code (e.g., `javascript`, `python`, `java`).

Here's another example with JavaScript:

```js
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```

### Benefits of this Approach

*   **Reliability:** Avoids parsing issues with backticks.
*   **Consistency:** Ensures consistent rendering across different Markdown parsers.
*   **Flexibility:** Allows for more fine-grained control over the code block's appearance and behavior.

### Conclusion

Using HTML's `<pre>` and `<code>` tags is a best practice for including code blocks in Markdown, especially when dealing with complex code or when consistency is critical. This approach ensures that your code is displayed correctly regardless of the Markdown parser used.
