This is an example blog post demonstrating various Markdown features and including a Rust code example. This post aims to showcase how to embed code snippets effectively within a blog post using HTML's `<pre>` and `<code>` tags to avoid issues with triple backticks (` ``` `) being misinterpreted by AI models.

### Introduction

In this post, we'll explore some basic Markdown formatting and then dive into a Rust code example. This is useful for developers who want to share code snippets in their blog posts without worrying about formatting issues.

### Markdown Formatting

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used for writing formatted text. It supports various formatting options, such as:

*   **Bold text:** `**Bold text**`
*   *Italic text:* `*Italic text*`
*   Lists:
    *   Item 1
    *   Item 2
*   Links: [Example Link](https://www.example.com)

### Rust Code Example

Here's an example of a simple Rust function that calculates the factorial of a number:

```rust
fn factorial(n: u64) -> u64 {
    match n {
        0 => 1,
        _ => n * factorial(n - 1),
    }
}

fn main() {
    let num = 5;
    let result = factorial(num);
    println!("The factorial of {} is {}", num, result);

    let num2 = 0;
    let result2 = factorial(num2);
    println!("The factorial of {} is {}", num2, result2);

    let num3 = 10;
    let result3 = factorial(num3);
    println!("The factorial of {} is {}", num3, result3);
}
```

This code defines a recursive function `factorial` and then uses it in the `main` function. This demonstrates a clear and concise way to represent code within a blog post. The `language-rust` class is important for syntax highlighting if your blog platform supports it.

### More Markdown Examples

Let's show a few more Markdown examples for completeness.

#### Headings

You can use different levels of headings:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

#### Images

You can also include images:

### Conclusion

This post has shown how to use Markdown and embed code snippets in a blog post. Using the `<pre>` and `<code>` tags ensures that your code is displayed correctly, even when processed by AI models. This approach prevents the confusion caused by triple backticks used in conventional code blocks. This is particularly useful for developers who frequently share code in their content. Using the correct class names, like `language-rust`, will enable syntax highlighting, making the code more readable. This method is also applicable for other languages by simply changing the class name (e.g., `language-python`, `language-javascript`).
